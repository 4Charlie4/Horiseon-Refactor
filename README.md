# Horiseon Refactor
 Refactor of CSS and HTML Horiseon page for accessibility and SEO purposes.

## HTML
 Added added webpage title and fixed links in nav bar.
 Provided semantic HTML elements to improve readability of code to ensure smoother debug/refactor in the future
 Left alt for images empty as they are not important to the content of the page and are just decorations
 Left comments in order to  log changes and help future developers

 ### CSS
 Consolidated and cleaned up code
 Deleted repeating code and created new classes.
 removed unnecessary classes
 notated where the changes were made and where code ended up

 Thank you!
